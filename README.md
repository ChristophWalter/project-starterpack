# My Starterpack

I noticed that I usually do the same things when starting a new side project or MVP. So I created this starter repository. It contains things I need to start and focus on the app itself.

## Features
- App-ready (Gridsome)
- Static Privacy Pages (Gridsome)
- Styling (Tailwind CSS)
- Code Style (Prettier)

## Deployment
Every push to master deploys to netlify using the default settings. An example can be found here: https://project-starterpack.netlify.app/
